# Intro
This is a Python Scipt used in my project work in the course AI2102.

In short: The Script is suppose to gather data for a Real Estate Market Analysis (REMA)
The data should be of the character that it can be used in a productivity analysis.


The project utilizes Python 2.7 and Hitta.se's REST API.

# A word on the programming
This is not the most elegant code in the world.
However, it works for me.

This can easily be done within a web browser instead.
But I used Python instead (don't ask me why...)
